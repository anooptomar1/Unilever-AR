# Unilever-AR
This ARKit app is a fun side project made by Peter Richards during an internship at Unilever during summer 2017. Leveraging existing code from Apple, it renders Unilever products in AR. It is not a complete consumer facing application, rather it is designed to show the potential of AR for a company like Unilever.
